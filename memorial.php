					<h2>Our Palmerton Veterans Memorial</h2>
					<p>We are so proud of our Veterans Memorial dedicated to the memory and service of all Veterans from the Palmerton Area from the Revolutionary Era to the present (A span of over 230 years). It has been added to the <a title="The National Registry of War Memorials- Palmerton Memorial" href="http://www.memorialdayfoundation.org/war-memorial-registry/pennsylvania/palmerton-area-veterans-memorial.html" target="_blank">National Registry of War Memorials</a>.</p>
					<p>We broke ground on Saturday, August 11, 2012.</p>
					<p>We commissioned the renowned sculptor James Nathan Muir of Sedona, Arizona to craft the beautiful Sculpture titled <em>Some Gave All</em>.</p>
					<p>It was dedicated on Veterans Day on November 11, 2012. We were honored to have Major General Rhett Hernandez and Col. Eric Hesse and other distinguished guests attend. It was a great day for Palmerton's Veterans of all American wars.</p>
