			<p>The Palmerton, PA  UVO combines the American Legion and VFW Posts of the Palmerton area of Carbon County PA. The two organizations share the same meeting space, many of the same members and are both groups of Veterans for Veterans. They have different criteria for membership, but they both welcome new membership! Veterans are a big part of the Palmerton community, participating in many town activities and giving back to the community through the efforts of these organizations.</p>
